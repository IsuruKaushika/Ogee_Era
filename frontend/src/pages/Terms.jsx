We may update, modify, or replace portions of these Terms by posting revisions on the Website, and you are responsible for reviewing this page regularly for updates.</p>
          <p className="mt-2">These Terms also govern your interaction with our social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.</p>
          
          <h3 className="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-[#414141]">General Conditions</h3>
          <p>We retain the right to deny service to any individual, at any time, for any reason. We may limit the availability of products/services offered.

          <p className="mt-2">Please be aware that products shown on the Website may not be available in physical stores, and vice versa. We cannot ensure that any product or service displayed on the Website will be in stock at a specific time or location.</p>
          <p className="mt-2">Product images on the Website are intended for visual reference only. While we strive to present products accurately, minor discrepancies between the images and actual items may occur.</p>
          <p className="mt-2">Adhering to the care instructions provided on product labels is essential to prevent damage. Any harm caused by improper care is not classified as a product defect.

          <p>To place an order, browse the Website, select items for your cart, and proceed to checkout. At checkout, you may either create an account or use the guest checkout feature. Account creation requires providing specific mandatory personal details.</p>
